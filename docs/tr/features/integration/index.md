## External Identity Providers

Trusted identity providers are key components of single sign-on. RustFS supports application and user identities through the following integrations.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ![Identity Provider 1](./images/identity-1.png) | ![Identity Provider 2](./images/identity-2.png) | ![Identity Provider 3](./images/identity-3.png) |

## External Key Management

Key Management Service (KMS) enables you to easily create and manage encryption keys and centrally control their usage across your organization.

## Monitoring and Alerting

Containers and microservices require continuous event monitoring and alerting. Keep a close eye on any cloud-native application or infrastructure through these integrations.

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![Monitoring 1](./images/monitoring-1.png) | ![Monitoring 2](./images/monitoring-2.png) | ![Monitoring 3](./images/monitoring-3.png) | ![Monitoring 4](./images/monitoring-4.png) |

## Notification Targets

Event notifications are central to any system's operational acuity. RustFS logs all object operations for lambda computing, object search, analytics, and security auditing.

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![Notification 1](./images/notification-1.png) | ![Notification 2](./images/notification-2.png) | ![Notification 3](./images/notification-3.png) | ![Notification 4](./images/notification-4.png) |

## Federation

When distributed deployments span datacenters and geographic locations, central federated authentication services are needed. RustFS integrates with the following.

| | |
|---|---|
| ![Federation 1](./images/federation-1.png) | ![Federation 2](./images/federation-2.png) |

## Orchestrators

RustFS supports modern cloud-native orchestration platforms for fully automated deployment and management of physical resources (CPU, network, and drives).

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ![Orchestrator 1](./images/orchestrator-1.png) | ![Orchestrator 2](./images/orchestrator-2.png) | ![Orchestrator 3](./images/orchestrator-3.png) |

## Load Balancers

For public-facing infrastructure, load balancers provide the following services: routing, service discovery, SSL termination, and traffic shaping. RustFS integrates with the following.

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![Load Balancer 1](./images/loadbalancer-1.png) | ![Load Balancer 2](./images/loadbalancer-2.png) | ![Load Balancer 3](./images/loadbalancer-3.png) | ![Load Balancer 4](./images/loadbalancer-4.png) |

## Hybrid Cloud

RustFS makes existing infrastructure from on-premises deployments to public clouds look like Amazon S3. Additionally, it adds caching CDN functionality in front of public clouds to save bandwidth while providing high performance.

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![Hybrid Cloud 1](./images/hybrid-1.png) | ![Hybrid Cloud 2](./images/hybrid-2.png) | ![Hybrid Cloud 3](./images/hybrid-3.png) | ![Hybrid Cloud 4](./images/hybrid-4.png) |

## Machine Learning and Big Data

Modern enterprises are data-driven. RustFS has native integrations with leading analytics and machine learning frameworks.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ![Machine Learning 1](./images/ml-1.png) | ![Machine Learning 2](./images/ml-2.png) | ![Machine Learning 3](./images/ml-3.png) |
| ![Machine Learning 4](./images/ml-4.png) | ![Machine Learning 5](./images/ml-5.png) | ![Machine Learning 6](./images/ml-6.png) |

## Backup

Object storage using the AWS S3 API has become the ubiquitous backup target for every modern backup application. RustFS integrates with S3-compatible systems including the following leading vendors (the list is long).

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![Backup 1](./images/backup-1.png) | ![Backup 2](./images/backup-2.png) | ![Backup 3](./images/backup-3.png) | ![Backup 4](./images/backup-4.png) |
