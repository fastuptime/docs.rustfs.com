# Video Storage Cost Reduction Solutions

Help video storage achieve dramatic cost reduction through object storage and hybrid cloud approaches

## Core Pain Points of Video Storage

### Traditional Solution Defects

- Linear storage architecture causes read/write speeds to decline as capacity increases
- Original videos occupy space, cold data long-term occupation of high-performance storage
- Single replica storage + periodic backup mechanism
- Storage expansion requires downtime maintenance, lacks intelligent management tools

### Business Impact

- Key frame retrieval delays exceed 5 seconds, emergency response efficiency reduced by 30%
- Storage costs increase 47% annually, 80% storage resources occupied by low-frequency access videos
- Hardware failures lead to 72-hour data recovery cycles, risk of critical evidence loss
- Manual operations cost $3.2/TB/month, system availability below 99%

## Five Core Cost Reduction Capabilities

### Storage Cost Direct Reduction 68%

- Original video frame-level compression algorithm (VFC-3 patent technology)
- Intelligent hot-cold separation: automatically identify videos not accessed for 30 days and transfer to glacier storage
- Support EB-level storage expansion, single TB cost as low as $0.015/month

### Minute-Level Data Access

- Global deployment of 128 edge nodes, transmission speed improved 5x
- Support 2000+ device concurrent writing, read/write latency less than 300ms
- Intelligent preloading technology: high-frequency access videos automatically cached to edge nodes

### Military-Grade Data Protection

- Three-replica storage + remote disaster recovery (compliant with ISO27001/Level 3 Security)
- Blockchain evidence storage: key videos generate timestamp hashes, judicial-level trusted evidence
- Version rollback: video recovery at any time point within 120 days

### Zero-Modification Access

- Compatible with 14 protocols including ONVIF/RTSP/GB28181
- Provides SDK/API/RESTful three access methods
- One-click migration tool for existing data (supports NAS/SAN/Ceph)

### Intelligent Operations Dashboard

- Real-time monitoring of storage health, cost distribution, access hotspots
- Capacity prediction algorithm: 3-day advance warning of storage bottlenecks
- Automatically generate monthly optimization recommendation reports

## Solutions

Frontend monitoring videos can be uploaded to cloud through three methods

### Hybrid Cloud Tiered Storage

Applicable scenarios: Large parks, smart cities (1000+ cameras)

#### Core Capabilities

- Intelligent tiering: hot data stored locally on SSD (response <100ms), full data automatically synced to cloud
- Direct cost reduction: cloud storage cost $0.021/GB-month, bandwidth usage reduced 80%
- Seamless disaster recovery: real-time active-active between local and cloud data

### Direct Cloud Storage

Applicable scenarios: Shops, communities, homes (50-200 cameras)

#### Core Advantages

- 5-minute ultra-simple deployment: scan-to-use, automatically adapts H.265 compression
- Intelligent management: motion detection automatically generates 30-second event clips
- Zero maintenance: fully managed cloud storage, data durability 99.9999999%

### Server Relay Storage

Applicable scenarios: Educational parks, cross-regional enterprises

#### Key Technologies

- Edge preprocessing: video frame extraction analysis (saves 90% traffic)
- Intelligent routing: automatically switches TCP/UDP protocols to ensure transmission
- Tiered archiving: original videos stored 30 days, low-bitrate copies stored 180 days
