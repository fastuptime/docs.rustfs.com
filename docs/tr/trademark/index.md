### Introduction

RustFS is a high-performance distributed object storage system. It is software-defined, runs on industry-standard hardware, and is 100% commercially friendly open source under the Apache Version 2.0 open source license.

This document outlines the RustFS project's policy regarding the use of its trademarks. Any use of RustFS trademarks must comply with this policy. For the purposes of this policy, "trademarks" refers to RustFS's word marks, service marks, logos, trade dress, product names, services, business and company names.

RustFS trademarks include RustFS and its derivative sub-products.

As firm believers in the spirit of free software and respected community members, we want users, distributors, and other community members to be able to widely use and improve our code, which is distributed under open source licenses. While our code is open source, RustFS wants to ensure that its trademarks remain reliable indicators of the quality and source that users expect from us. Strict enforcement of our trademark rights is also very important to protect our users from those who use trademarks fraudulently. This means that while you have considerable freedom to redistribute and modify our software, you must comply with trademark law and this policy, even for open source software. Balancing these two competing interests is not easy. We rely on our users, customers, and community to help us achieve this balance.

### General Guidelines

The fundamental basis of RustFS's trademark policy is the general law of trademarks.

RustFS is designed to be used and extended, and RustFS recognizes that community members may need some way to identify RustFS products in some way, but you must ensure that consumers are not confused about whether they are official (meaning approved by RustFS).

Your use of RustFS trademarks must always avoid confusion. People should always know who they are dealing with and where the software they download comes from. Websites and software not made or officially authorized by RustFS should not directly or indirectly suggest that they are made or officially authorized by RustFS.

If you have any doubts or need clarification, please email <hello@rustfs.com>

### What You Can Do

You may distribute the unmodified official binaries downloaded from <https://rustfs.com/download> to anyone in any way, subject to the relevant terms of applicable law and licenses, without obtaining any further permission from RustFS. However, you may not remove or alter any RustFS trademarks. In your websites or other materials, you may truthfully state that the software you provide is an unmodified version of RustFS, keeping in mind the general guidelines regarding the use of RustFS trademarks detailed in this policy document. We recommend that if you choose to provide website visitors with the opportunity to download RustFS binaries, you can help ensure faster and more reliable downloads by linking to our website for downloads.

You may use RustFS trademarks in marketing and other promotional materials. This includes indicating that an individual or organization is shipping or selling RustFS products. Of course, any use of RustFS trademarks must comply with the fundamental requirement that its use must not cause confusion.

**RustFS-related services:** If you provide RustFS-related services, you may use RustFS trademarks when describing and promoting your services, as long as you do not violate the general guidelines for using RustFS trademarks or do anything that might mislead customers into believing that RustFS has any direct relationship with your organization.

**Logos and merchandise:** You may make T-shirts, desktop wallpapers, or baseball caps with RustFS logos, but only for yourself and your friends (i.e., people from whom you will not receive any valuable return).

You may use RustFS trademarks to truthfully reference and/or link to unmodified RustFS programs, products, services, and technologies.

### What You Cannot Do

1. You cannot put the RustFS logo on any product you commercially produce.
2. You may not modify RustFS trademarks, abbreviate them, or combine them with any other symbols, words, or images, or incorporate them into slogans or catchphrases.
3. You may not create modified versions of RustFS Logos for any purpose.
4. You may not use RustFS trademarks in a way that falsely suggests that RustFS is associated with, sponsors, endorses, or approves your product or service.
5. You may not use RustFS trademarks for any form of commercial use unless such use is limited to truthful and descriptive references.
6. You cannot use RustFS trademarks in the names and titles of social media accounts.

You may modify RustFS software under open source license terms, but you may not redistribute your modifications under any RustFS trademarks. For example, your product or website should not say "Based on RustFS." Instead, to be completely accurate, you should describe it as "Based on RustFS technology" or "Contains RustFS source code." You must also change the name of the product and binaries to reduce the likelihood that users of the modified software will be misled into believing it is native RustFS or affiliated with us.

### What Permissions You Need

If you plan to use RustFS trademarks as website icons, you need to request permission.

**Domain names:** If you want to include all or part of RustFS trademarks in domain names, you must obtain written permission from RustFS. Almost any use of RustFS trademarks in domain names can confuse consumers and therefore violates the general requirement that the use of RustFS trademarks must not cause confusion.

### How to Use Our Trademarks

1. **Correct form** - RustFS trademarks should be used in their accurate form - neither abbreviated nor combined with any other words.
2. **Accompanying symbols** - The first or most prominent mention of RustFS trademarks should be accompanied by a symbol indicating whether the trademark is a registered trademark ("Â®") or an unregistered trademark ("â„¢");
3. **Attribution statement** - The following statement should appear somewhere near the use of RustFS trademarks (at least on the same page): "[Trademark] is a ["registered," if applicable] trademark of RustFS Corporation";
4. **Distinguishable** - Trademarks should be distinguished from surrounding text, which can be distinguished by capitalization, italics, bold, or underlining.

You may not alter any RustFS logos except to scale them. This means you may not add decorative elements, change colors, change proportions, distort it, add elements, or combine it with other logos. However, when the context requires the use of black and white graphics and the logo is colored, you may reproduce the logo in a way that produces a black and white image.

### Questions

RustFS has tried to make its trademark policy as comprehensive as possible. If you are considering using RustFS trademarks not covered by this policy and are unsure whether such use violates RustFS guidelines, please contact us at <hello@rustfs.com>.

If RustFS determines at any time in its sole discretion that your use of any of our trademarks violates this policy, we may revoke your license to use it, and you must immediately stop all use of that trademark.

This policy may be updated from time to time. Please refer to this page for all updates.
