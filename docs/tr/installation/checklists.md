# Checklists

The following documents contain pre-installation checklists for RustFS, including a series of necessary preparations and considerations required before preparing the production environment.

These checklists cannot fully meet the precise requirements of your unique deployment architecture, production characteristics, and production metrics. We recommend that you seek professional guidance based on your production environment, production characteristics, production metrics, and the version of RustFS you are using.

If you need professional guidance, please contact our storage experts: 400-033-5363 or email: <hello@rustfs.com>.

If you need community support, you can submit issues on GitHub or join our discussion groups. We do not guarantee the quality and results of community responses and do not provide SLA guarantees.
